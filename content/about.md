---------------------------

I'm working as a Risk-Manager at BMW and I have a M.Sc. in Data Science from [HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/). 
My master thesis was about scraping new car configurators with [RSelenium](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/index.html) and you can read more about it in this [blogpost](../posts/2022-06-03-new-car-scraper/) and check the funny [whicha](https://landoltricardo.shinyapps.io/whicha/) prototype app. 
In this context I also released a r package named [shadowr](../posts/2022-04-30-hello-shadowr/), which enable R users a more comfortable and reliable way to work with shadow dom elements. Further, I created a little shiny app to make it easy for the automotive industry to analyse the development of new car registrations. Currently I'm also gathering data from autoscout and carforyou and you can check some quick insights [here](../posts/2022-04-30-hello-shadowr/).
People often don't understand why i call coding a hobby, but people also don't understand, that you don't store structured data in an excel.
