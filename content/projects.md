## whicha the cross-brand configurator

This app represents a cross-brand new car configurator and has been developed as a minimum viable product and is not to be considered as ready for economical use yet.
In order to build this configurator, first vehicle data had to be obtained and for this purpose, new car configurators were scraped from the respective brands. The vehicles and options as well as their prices were extracted. The technical data was also scraped, but not from the manufacturers' websites but from adac. You can find the app under the following [Link](https://landoltricardo.shinyapps.io/immatapp).
